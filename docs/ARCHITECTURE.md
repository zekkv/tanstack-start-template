# Architecture

This project is opinionated towards [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and follows a modern SSR architecture using TanStack Start and Nitro.

## Core Stack

- **Framework**: [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start) — full-stack React with TanStack Router, server functions, and SSR.
- **Server**: [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/) — handles server-side logic and deployment presets.
- **ORM & Database**: [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) with Bun's native SQL driver (`bun:sql` / `drizzle-orm/bun-sql`) — high-performance, zero-dependency PostgreSQL access.
- **Auth**: [Better Auth](https://better-auth.com/) — email + password, email OTP, passkeys, and optional Google OAuth. Rate limited at the Better Auth layer (20 req/60 s).
- **Theme**: [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes) — class-based theme management on `html` with a mounted client toggle.

## Data Flow

1. **Routing**: Managed by TanStack Router. `src/routes/__root.tsx` composes the shell, theme provider, header, and page outlet.
2. **SSR**: TanStack Start handles the initial HTML render on the server via Nitro.
3. **Protected routes**: `dashboard.tsx` and `settings.tsx` call `getCurrentUser()` in `beforeLoad`. Unauthenticated requests redirect to `/login`. Auth routes (`/login`, `/signup`) redirect already-signed-in users to `/dashboard`.
4. **Server functions**: `src/features/notes/server-fns.ts` exposes `listNotes`, `createNote`, and `deleteNote` via `createServerFn`. Each function re-checks the session server-side.
5. **Auth flow**: Forms in `src/features/auth/components/*` call `src/lib/auth-client.ts`. `/login` supports email + password, email OTP, passkeys, and Google OAuth (when configured). `/signup` creates a password account (then holds the user on a "check your email" prompt) or sends an OTP; `/verify-otp` confirms the code and offers passkey enrollment; `/reset-password` both requests a reset link and consumes it (`?token=`).
6. **Email dispatch**: `src/routes/api/send-email.ts` requires either an authenticated session or a valid `x-email-secret` header. Dispatch itself goes through `src/lib/mailer.ts`, which throws a clear error when `RESEND_API_KEY` is not set.
7. **File uploads**: `src/routes/api/upload-url.ts` generates a presigned PUT URL (S3-compatible). The client uploads directly to storage; the server never proxies file bytes.

## Authentication

Handled by **Better Auth**. Supported flows:

- **Email + password** — sign up and sign in with a password. The sign-up and reset forms share `PasswordSchema` (`src/features/auth/schema/password.ts`): 8–128 characters with at least one number and one symbol. That policy is client-side; Better Auth itself only enforces its 8-character minimum, so add a `before` hook on `/sign-up/email` and `/reset-password` if you need it enforced server-side too. Always available. Password hashes live in the existing `account.password` column, so no migration is involved. Sign-ups are stored with an empty `name`, matching what the email-OTP flow does, and are auto-signed-in (`requireEmailVerification` is off, so an unverified user can still sign in).
- **Email verification** — `emailVerification.sendOnSignUp` mails a link via the `VerificationEmail` template; Better Auth's own `/api/auth/verify-email` endpoint consumes it, so there is no app route for it. `/signup` shows a "check your email" prompt after a password sign-up rather than navigating away, because the window this closes is otherwise invisible: an email-OTP sign-in by an **unverified** user triggers Better Auth's `revokeUnprovenAccountAccess`, which deletes every account row and session that user has (its defence against someone registering a password on an address they do not own) — so an unverified password would be discarded the first time that user signs in with a code. Verified users keep their password across an OTP sign-in. Set `emailAndPassword.requireEmailVerification: true` if you would rather block sign-in until the link is clicked.
- **Password reset** — `/reset-password` sends a link (1 hour expiry) via `ResetPasswordEmail`. Better Auth's callback bounces the emailed link off `/api/auth/reset-password/:token` and back to `/reset-password?token=…`, or `?error=INVALID_TOKEN` when it has expired. Reset also _creates_ a credential account when the user has none, so OTP-only and Google-only users can adopt a password this way. It does not create a session; the user signs in afterwards.
- **Email OTP** — sign in and sign up via one-time code. Always available.
- **Passkeys** — register and authenticate with a device credential. Always available.
- **Google OAuth** — enabled only when `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` are set. The app boots and functions without them.

Rate limiting is configured at 20 requests per 60-second window using Better Auth's built-in `rateLimit` option.

## Styling

**Tailwind CSS v4** is integrated via `@tailwindcss/vite`. Theme switching is class-based on the `html` element through `next-themes`.

## Observability

### LogTape + Sentry

LogTape provides the app logger in `src/lib/logger.ts`. The server bootstrap (`instrument.server.mjs`) initialises Sentry with:

- `sendDefaultPii: false` — PII is not forwarded by default.
- `tracesSampleRate: 0.1` — 10% of server traces are sampled to control cost.

Enable `sendDefaultPii: true` and raise `tracesSampleRate` only intentionally, after reviewing your data-handling obligations.
